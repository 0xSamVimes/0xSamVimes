- 👋 Hi, I’m @0xSamVimes
- 👀 I’m interested in decentralized finance, decentralized applications.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web3 stack, EVM compatible solidity smart contracts, React w/ ethers.js, hosting on IPFS
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to accessible financial applications for people who have no direct interest in crypto. I'm not interested in moonshots, ponzis or pump and dumps.
- 📫 You can reach me on twitter @SamuellVimes
